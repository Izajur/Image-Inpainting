# Image Inpainting
This project is an implementation of "Region Filling and Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Image Inpainting" by A.Criminisi et al. 2004.

All code is written in MATLAB.

There's also a pdf file I used to present this project with a summary of how this algorithm works.

The folder images contains some images, with their relative masks and the inpainted images.
